#Datavisualisation Tracklog

Datavisualisation from the tracklog api: http://stud.cmi.hro.nl/0896704/tracklog

Created a little game where everybody can move around a map and try to find where i have been. This data is obtained from an api i created for a school assignment.

###Player:
- Can move around the map
- Has a compass pointing to the one you are looking for. (compass will stop working when you are in a close range of the one you are looking for).

###The game:
- Cycles every 10 seconds to a new entry from the api
- You walk around to find clues.
- When you think you know who the one you are following is you can raise your hand.
