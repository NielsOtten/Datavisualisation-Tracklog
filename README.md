#Datavisualisation Tracklog

Datavisualisation from the tracklog api: http://stud.cmi.hro.nl/0896704/tracklog

##Concept 1:
Every entry is shown on a map and connect through lines. You can click on categories, datatypes or companies to minimize the data that is shown.

##Concept 2:
This concept is kinda like "scotland yard" the board game.

###Player:
- Can move around the map
- Has a compass pointing to the one you are looking for. (compass will stop working when you are in a close range of the one you are looking for).

###The one:
- Will move around trough every entry.
- (? Can be controlled by someone)
- (? Shoots at your location)

###The game:
- Cycles every 10 seconds to a new entry, will begin at the first entry en at the last entry it will start over.
- Game starts when someone clicks start
- Game ens when someone is really close to "The one"
